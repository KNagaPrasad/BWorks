# BWorks
In order to promote bicycles as an affordable and eco-friendly mode of transportation, BWorks is a community-driven project. The program aims to provide low-cost bicycles to individuals and encourage them to embrace cycling for transportation, recreation, and personal health.
Refurbishing and redistributing donated or unused bicycles is at the core of the BWorks project. The project provides functional and reliable transportation options to people from all economic backgrounds by repairing and revitalizing these bikes.
As part of the BWorks project, educators offer workshops and educational programs dedicated to bike maintenance, safety, and riding skills. Taking part in these initiatives empowers individuals with the knowledge and confidence to ride a bicycle safely and maintain their bicycles effectively.
